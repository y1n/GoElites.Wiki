*Here is a list of most known issues which may occur during the use of GoElites application and solutions to them*.

| Issue | Solution |
|--|--|
| **Loader won't start!** | Make sure you have correctly installed all of the prerequisite software (*these exact versions*) mentioned in [Installation](/GettingStarted/Installation.md) instructions. |
| **Loader starts and logs in but everything shuts down afterwards!** | Run loader as administrator and make sure that compatibility mode is not enabled. If issue persists, make sure that Windows Defender is disabled and no other antivirus software tries to interfere with GoElites. |
| **Are you ready to crash?** | It means that either you are not subscriber or your HWID is locked. HWID lock means that since you have recently played using GoElites on other computer, you now have to wait 12 hours before you can use other computer to play using GoElites. **Note**: if you're sure you haven't played on any other computer within last 24 hours, please change your password and contact **PRADA#3385** as your account may have been hacked. |
| **I press buttons but functions won't execute! But drawings work fine!** | Your configuration file must be messed up then. Go to ``%appdata%``, find folder with long random name and delete it. It will be generated automatically by GoElites and settings will be restored to default. |
| **Loader says it fails to inject!** | Make sure both GoElites Loader and League of Legends are ran as administrator, also it is very likely that your antivirus won't allow GoElites to inject properly. Also try installing [DirectX June 2010](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=8109). |
| **Game crashes during loading screen!** | Make sure your game runs in *Borderless* or *Windowed* more. Fullscreen is not supported as of now. |
| **Loader won't install! Says I don't have permissions but I'm the administrator of PC!** | Please disable your antivirus, add your installation folder in antivirus exception list and try again. |
| **Loader injects properly, I can open menu but I don't see drawings!** | It occurs mainly for Windows 7 users who don't have some Windows Updates installed. Please make sure you have all of the latest updates. If didn't help, make sure you've got [DirectX June 2010](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=8109) installed (*it is installed with DXSETUP.exe ([where?](https://s.put.re/EHZ1Y5R.png))*). |
| **How do I change my login credentials after I check autologin?** | Open *Run dialog box* (``Win+R``), type in ``regedit``, go to ``HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Elites\Go`` and change *AutoLogin* setting to *False*. |
| **Website shows that [Happy Hour](https://goelites.net/index.php?/topic/941-happy-hours/) is right now but when I try to go in game, it says that I don't have Subscription**| Please check [UTC](https://time.is/en/UTC) time once again, it may be that timer is shown incorrectly on the website. You can play for free 3 times per day:</br>- 7:00 - 8:00 [UTC](https://time.is/en/UTC).</br>- 15:00 - 16:00 [UTC](https://time.is/en/UTC).</br>- 23:00 - 24:00 [UTC](https://time.is/en/UTC). |
