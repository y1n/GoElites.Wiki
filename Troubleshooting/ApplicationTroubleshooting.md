*Here is a list of most known issues which may occur during the use of GoElites application and solutions to them*.

| Issue | Solution |
|--|--|
| **The loader won't start!** | Make sure you have correctly installed all of the prerequisite software (*these exact versions*) mentioned in [Installation](../GettingStarted/Installation.md) instructions. |
| **Loader starts and logs in but everything shuts down afterwards!** | Run loader as administrator and make sure that compatibility mode is not enabled. If issue persists, make sure that Windows Defender is disabled and no other antivirus software tries to interfere with GoElites. |
| **Game asks if I'm ready to crash after it starts!** | It means that either you are not subscriber or your HWID is locked. HWID lock means that since you have recently played using GoElites on other computer, you now have to wait 12 hours before you can use other computer to play using GoElites. **Note**: if you're sure you haven't played on any other computer within last 24 hours, please change your password and contact **PRADA#3611** as your account may have been hacked. |
| **I press buttons but functions won't execute! But everything else works fine!** | Your configuration file must be messed up then. Go to ``%appdata%``, find folder named "*ImGui*" and delete it. It will be generated automatically by GoElites and settings will be restored to default. |
| **Loader says it's unable to inject / find core!** | Make sure both GoElites Loader and League of Legends are ran as administrator, also it is very likely that your antivirus won't allow GoElites to inject properly. |
| **Game crashes during loading screen!** | Make sure your game runs in *Borderless* or *Windowed* more. Fullscreen is not supported as of now. |
| **Loader won't install! Says I don't have permissions but I'm the administrator of PC!** | Please disable your antivirus, add your installation folder in antivirus exception list and try again. |
| **Application injects properly, I can open menu but I don't see drawings!** | It occurs mainly for Windows 7 users who don't have some Windows Updates installed. Please make sure you have all of the latest updates. If didn't help, make sure you've got [DirectX June 2010](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=8109) installed (*it is installed with DXSETUP.exe ([where?](https://s.put.re/EHZ1Y5R.png))*) |
