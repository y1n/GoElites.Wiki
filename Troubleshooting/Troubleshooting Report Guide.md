We always strive to provide flawless experience for you guys since we are users of our software ourselves too, however there is always  an issue which occur here and there that may spoil the overall impression. The problem is, most of the issues are not systematic and occur only under certain conditions which are sometimes really hard to predict and detect, and therefore we highly rely on your help here!

While we are sure that most issues are already documented here, there may still be some new ones that you could have unfortunately came across. And for this particular case, we have [General Assistance](https://goelites.net/index.php?/forum/35-general-assistance/) category on our forum where you can report your issue.

But before you submit your report, please make sure that you're aquainted with the standards of how to submit a report. These are important for us as it really shortens the process of issue investigation by a lot, so it is great for both you and staff representative who will look into your case.

## Troubleshooting Report Guidelines

First of all, please check out [Troubleshooting Guides](https://goelites.net/index.php?/forum/35-general-assistance/&do=add) section. If you couldn't find a solution to your issue there, try using forum search ([where?](https://s.put.re/zvYmhVo.png)) and wiki search ([where?](https://s.put.re/nXLET4e.png)). There is a very high chance that the solution to your issue was already posted before. If you didn't find the information you need, please submit a [Troubleshooting Report](https://goelites.net/index.php?/forum/35-general-assistance/&do=add). Here is the list of information we would like you to provide in advance: 
1. **Error logs** (*if there were any*). This will help us identify whether your issue caused by required software malfunction or the loader error.
2. **The way to reproduce the issue**. If there is some specific way to cause the error to appear - please tell us and we will have more information on whether the issue is on our side or on your.
3. **What possible solutions have you already tried in order to fix it yourself** (*if you have*). It will help us discard some steps we would have suggested.
- If you feel like there is anything else to add to help us identify your issue, please include it in your report. More information is better than less, even if it may serve no use in your case. 
4. When you feel like your report is complete - press "**Start New Topic**" and our team will review it and try to help you as soon as possible. Thanks for your trust and cooperation!
