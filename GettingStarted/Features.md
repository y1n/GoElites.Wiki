### How it works

GoElites comes on *All-In-One* basis, which means that everything that we believe player needs in-game is included in one package and is loaded without any additional settings required. Every module, however, is highly customizable and can be adjusted in accordance with user's preferences using in-game menu. Every module can also be disabled. This allows us to keep GoElites easy-to-setup and easy-to-use without taking a toll on precious CPU and RAM.
