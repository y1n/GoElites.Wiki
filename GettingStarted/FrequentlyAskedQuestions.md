*Here is a collection of questions that staff and helpful members get asked on daily basis. They are not troubleshooting-related so there are very few reliable sources where answers to these questions can be found. We will try to give comprehensive answers to most of them here!*

### Question 1: How different is GoElites from other services out there?

---

*Answer*: In GoElites, our greatest value is your experience as our community member. We strive to provide the best service by supplying you with easy-to-setup yet exceptionally efficient software and quick, professional support in case something goes wrong. You're also able to easily get in touch with other like-minded people in our community and find partners to play or even build friendship with. Regardless of what you're willing to do on GoElites (*within boundaries set in Community Guidelines*), we will do our best to make it worthwhile!

### Question 2: Can I use your software on my device?

---

*Answer*: Our software can currently only be ran on devices with Windows 7 or higher installed (*and which support .NET Framework 4*). You have to run emulator (*like Boot Camp for MacOS*) in order to be able to use our software on other operational systems.

### Question 3: Can I help?

---

*Answer*: Yes. If you come across someone who has encountered a problem you know how to solve - help him out! Also, if you feel like we lack people who speak your language in our team which results in some violations remaining unnoticed or people lacking proper assistance - please reach us out and tell about it. If you are known as helpful and trustworthy member of our community - you'll be able to join our support team.

### Question 4: Will you release an API so other developers can release their scripts?

---

*Answer*: No such plans for now!

### Question 5: Is there any certain order for champion script releases? What champions should we expect next?

---

*Answer*: First we port OKTW champions, then we will start a poll. Generally, champions are ported in accordance with the demand.
