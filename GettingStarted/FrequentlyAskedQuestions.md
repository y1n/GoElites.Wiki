Yes. If you come across someone who has encountered a problem you know how to solve - help him out! Also, if you feel like we lack people who speak your language in our team which results in some violations remaining unnoticed or people lacking proper assistance - please reach us out and tell about it. If you are known as helpful and trustworthy member of our community - you'll be able to join our support team.
